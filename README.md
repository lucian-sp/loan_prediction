Loan Prediction

Predicting the customer's eligibility to get a loan.

I worked on this project during the Analytics Vidhya DataHack Hour. The test/train data is provided by them and the goal was learning.

Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers.


What i did:

I worked only on the train dataset applying a variety of regression algorithms and ensemble models.

1. Replaced the Nans, identified outliers, feature selection and normalization.
2. Built and evaluated the regression models.
3. Built and evaluated the ensemble models: averaging, weighted averaging, voting, weighted voting and bagging.
